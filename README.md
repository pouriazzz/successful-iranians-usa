### Content
You can update the statistics and content in the HTML file to reflect the most current information about Iranian Americans and their contributions. All facts included are based on reputable sources, but you may want to verify and update them periodically.

## Project Purpose

This website aims to educate the American public and government officials about the significant contributions of Iranian Americans to U.S. society. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the Iranian people and the Iranian government, highlighting that Iranian Americans are among the most educated, law-abiding, and productive citizens in the United States.

The site advocates for fair treatment of Iranian Americans and Iranians seeking to enter the United States, suggesting that travel bans and restrictive policies separate families and prevent talented individuals from contributing to American society.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:
- A more extensive database of notable Iranian Americans
- Interactive timeline of Iranian immigration to the USA
- Stories and personal accounts
- Resources section for further reading
- News updates about recent achievements
